# Project-A
 This is my first project as part of my IBM course. In this project, Iâ€™ll apply the skills learned to create a [mention general outcome, e.g., simple app, data analysis, etc.], focusing on clean code and using Git and GitHub for version control. Feedback and collaboration are welcome!
